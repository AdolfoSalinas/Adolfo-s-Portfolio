# [Project 3: Human Resources Classifier -- Logistic Regression/Random Forest and Artificial/Neural Network](https://github.com/AdolfoSalinas/Human_Resources_Classifier/blob/main/README.md)

Create a classifier using Human Resources data to determine which Employees are most likely to quit.
Compare outputs of Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Network.


In this case Random Forest produced the best results slightly edging out the logistic regression, the accuracy was higher, and the Type II errors were less. 
The ANN was the worst performer but would likely need more tuning of the parameters with a grid search to improve results.
